# Safetensors Manager

## Overview

Safetensors Manager is a Python package designed to handle the merging and splitting of `.safetensors` files. It allows you to combine multiple `.safetensors` files into one or split a large `.safetensors` file into smaller chunks/shards for easier management while also generating the `model.safetensors.index.json` and `chunk_paths.json` files ( HuggingFace standards ).
